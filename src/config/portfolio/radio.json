  "description": "<p>This mockup was created to incorporate a blog driven site that would require a large menu. Usually large menus are set up as a drop down menu.  That allows you to have a large menu that does not take up a lot of screen real estate.   I wanted to approach this differently and see if I could create a site with a large menu that is listed staticly</p>",
